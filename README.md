# Hospital Management System

## Project Description
The Hospital Management System is a C++ application designed to automate hospital operations like patient registration, bed allocation, medicine ordering, and billing. The system efficiently handles patient data, assigns available beds, tracks medication orders, and generates invoices upon discharge. The project uses Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) to insert, update, and display records.

## Installation/Usage

Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. **Check if `gcc` is Installed**

   To verify if `gcc` is installed on your system, open the terminal and run:
    ```bash
    gcc --version
    ```
   If `gcc` is installed, this command will display the version information. If not, you will need to install `gcc` ([GCC Releases page](https://gcc.gnu.org/releases.html)).

2. **Clone the Repository**

   Clone the repository with the following command:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/username/hospital-management-system.git
    cd hospital-management-system
    ```

3. **Compile the C++ Code Using `gcc`**

   Compile the C++ code with:
    ```bash
    gcc -o HospitalManagementSystem main.cpp
    ```

4. **Run the Executable**

   Run the compiled executable:
    ```bash
    ./HospitalManagementSystem
    ```

## Features
- **Patient Registration**: Registers new patients by capturing essential details.
  
- **Bed Allocation**: Automatically allocates beds if available upon patient registration.

- **Medicine Orders**: Enables patients to order prescribed medicines as instructed by doctors.

- **Invoice Generation**: Generates a comprehensive invoice when patients are discharged.

- **Discharge Process**: Releases beds and finalizes patient data upon discharge.

## Data Structures and Algorithms Used
The project employs various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) to manage data operations:
- **Insertion**: Efficiently inserts patient records using [mention data structure here].
- **Update**: Updates records as patient information or statuses change.
- **Display**: Displays patient records, bed allocations, and more using [mention DSA techniques].
