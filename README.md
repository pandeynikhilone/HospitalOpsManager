# Hospital Management System

## Project Description
The Hospital Management System is a C++ application designed to automate hospital operations like patient registration, bed allocation, medicine ordering, and billing. The system efficiently handles patient data, assigns available beds, tracks medication orders, and generates invoices upon discharge. The project uses Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) to insert, update, and display records.

## Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/username/hospital-management-system.git
    cd hospital-management-system
    ```

2. Install necessary dependencies (if any):
    ```bash
    # Example command
    sudo apt-get install <dependency-name>
    ```

3. Compile the C++ code:
    ```bash
    g++ main.cpp -o HospitalManagementSystem
    ```

4. Run the executable:
    ```bash
    ./HospitalManagementSystem
    ```

*(Edit this section according to your projectâ€™s specific setup.)*

## Usage
To run the program in the Windows terminal:

1. Open the terminal and navigate to the project directory.
2. Compile the C++ code:
    ```bash
    g++ main.cpp -o HospitalManagementSystem.exe
    ```

3. Run the compiled program:
    ```bash
    HospitalManagementSystem.exe
    ```

## Features
- **Patient Registration**: Registers new patients by capturing essential details.
  
- **Bed Allocation**: Automatically allocates beds if available upon patient registration.

- **Medicine Orders**: Enables patients to order prescribed medicines as instructed by doctors.

- **Invoice Generation**: Generates a comprehensive invoice when patients are discharged.

- **Discharge Process**: Releases beds and finalizes patient data upon discharge.

## Data Structures and Algorithms Used
The project employs various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) to manage data operations:
- **Insertion**: Efficiently inserts patient records using [mention data structure here].
- **Update**: Updates records as patient information or statuses change.
- **Display**: Displays patient records, bed allocations, and more using [mention DSA techniques].

*(You can expand on this section to specify which data structures, like linked lists, trees, or hash tables, were used and how.)*
